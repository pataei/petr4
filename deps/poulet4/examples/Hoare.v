(* Using the WP hoare calculus, we can reason about output states and results for monadic programs.
   
  To reason about programs that might fail under a precondition P, we must use a total hoare calculus, notated by: 
    {{ P }} potentially_failing_program {{ Q }}.
    For such programs Q must handle both the normal and error cases, and so is a function 
    (Result + Exception) -> State -> Prop.

  While this total calculus is expressive, it's convenient to restrict the scope to
  partial triples, in which the program will never fail under a precondition P.
  For this we notate a partial hoare triple as 
  << P >> always_successful_program << Q >>.

  A benefit of partial triples is that we can use the monadic properties of the specification calculus
  to automate proofs. See the bottom of this file for examples.

(* Consider a silly program with a single nat as state, that increments the nat and
 * immediately fails. We can prove that this program A) always fails and B) increments the state.
 *)
Example fail_incr n:
  {{ fun s => s = n }}
    @put_state nat unit (fun x => x + 1) ;; @state_fail nat unit nat tt
  {{ fun ve s => 
    match ve with 
    | inl _ => False (* property A), the program always fails *)
    | inr _ => s = n + 1 (* property B), the final state is one larger than the initial state *)

   * So to do this, we wrap the inductive hypothesis with weaken_post_p.
